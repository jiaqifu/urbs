Demand Side Management Documentation
************************************

This documentation explains the Demand Side Management feature of urbs. 
With it, one can model time variant Demand Side Management Up/Downshift 
in a concrete energy MIMO system, for example, one smart city grid.




Introduction
============
The DSM up/downshifts are closely related to commoditiesï¼Œ 
which are given by default in the urbs with their energy content (MWh). 
The size of the modelled market has to be considered small relative to 
the surrounding market. To use this feature, the excel input file needs 
an additional **Demand Side Management** sheet with the five parameters 
containing the columns ``delay``, ``eff``, ``recov``, ``cap-max-do`` and 
``cap-max-up``, which are used in DSM constraints as technical parameters. 
For a more detailed description of the implementation have a look at the 
Mathematical Documentation. 


Exemplification
===============

This section contains prototypical scenarios illustrating the system 
behaviour with time variant DSM up/downshifts. 
In this part there is an island as an example named ``Greenland``, which 
composed of three sites ``Mid``, ``North``, and ``South``. Between the 
three sites most of the electricity from ``South`` has to be transported 
to supply ``Mid``. The electricity of ``North`` is relatively independent 
of the other two parts.

When appears the electricity DSM downshifts in the process?

- it is *necessary* to constraint the whole system with DSM downshifts, if 
the demand is greater than the total output capacity.
- it is *profitable* to constraint the whole system with DSM downshifts, if 
 the demand keeps on increasing till the peak value.

When appears the electricity DSM downshifts in the process?

- it is *possible* **and** *profitable* to constraint the whole system with 
DSM upshifts, if the demand is lesser than the total output capacity **and** 
keeps on decreasing ceaselessly




High Maximal Up/Downshift Capacity 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
All process, transmission and storage capacities are predetermined and 
constant.

The following scenario illustrates the energy balance of the ``South`` of 
``greenland``. It has a demand of 50-100 GW that is supplied by a 50 GW 
photovoltaics plant and a 50 GW wind plant. In addition a 50 GW transmission 
cable exports electricity, which connects the ``Mid`` of island with the grid 
of ``South``. Both capacities and prices are fix. Because of the meteorological 
effects on Photovoltaics plants, the timesteps began at the 3000. hour of the 
year, which was also the beginning of the summer.

The modelled timesplan lasted 7 days with five parameters from DSM sheet in ``
greenland south.xlsx``. In the first ten hours of day 1 the electricity power
was at a high level, because the supply was much less than the demand. So the 
DSM began with downshifts. But the situation will change into opposite direction 
over time. After the supply exceeded, the demand the DSM upshifts appeared to 
take place of downshifts. How much electricity can the photovoltaics plants and 
wind plants generate all depending on the weather conditions. The wind plants 
worked the whole day 24 hours, as long as the wind blow strongly enough. But 
photovoltaics plants generated electricity only in the daytime, that is why the
parameter ``delay`` was set to 16 hours. It just coincided the time in one day, 
that was covered by the sunshine. Before the second day the wind blew strongly 
enough, so that the surplus of wind plant generated electricity was converted 
into storage. From the 3. day the wind became weakly, and the electricity of 
storage had to be taken out to meet the demand. At the midnight of the 5. day 
electricity capacity came to the lowest point of all, and the output and input 
kept nearly in balance.  Not only the frequency of scenario_base up/downshifts``, 
but also the amount of times of``up/downshifts`` will decrease correspondingly. 
There was relative more volatility of electricity capacity in the seven days 
simulation than it without DSM.

If do not change commodity stock prices, global CO2 limit and maximum installable 
capacity in ``runme.py``, and just only consider the ``scenario_base``, it will be 
more clearly to show how the DSM affects the electricity commodities .

Low Maximal Up/Downshift Capacity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
All process, transmission and storage capacities are predetermined and constant.

For the second scenario, the ``North`` of greenland will replaced the ``South``.
Compared to the ``South``, the electricity supply of ``North`` was relatively 
simple and independent. It had a demand of 10000-15000 MW, and the supply was 
dominated by wind plants. Additionally there was about 2500 MW needed to be 
provided by Purchase.

The modelled timesplan lasted also 7 days with five parameters from DSM sheet in 
``greenland north.xlsx``.  The electricity supply of ``North`` was dominated by 
wind plants. The wind plants worked for 24 hours in one whole day, and the wind 
power strong or weak has nothing to do with the change of time. so the parameter 
``delay`` was set to 8 hours. Because the peak value of the output of ``North`` 
was just close to 15 GW, the ``cap-max-do`` and ``cap-max-up`` were set to 500 MW, 
which was a quarter of South's. The electricity in the first four days, which was 
generated by wind plants, kept at a higher level. That is why the up/downshifts 
appeared frequently, regularly, and alternately during this time. But in the last 
three days the wind became weakly, and the electricity of storage had to be taken 
out to meet the demand. Then during the three days downshifts dominated in most 
case. With DSM up/downshifts intelligent allocation of electricity resources is 
required to avoid the shortage of electricity supply during peak hours and the 
overcapacity in the usual time.

No Maximal Up/Downshift Capacity 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
All process, transmission and storage capacities are predetermined and constant.

The last scenario illustrates the energy balance of the ``Mid`` of ``greenland``. 
It has a demand of 50-70 GW that is mostly supplied by a 50 GW transmission, which 
came from ``South``. In addition, a 13 GW wind plant and 16 GW Photovoltaics plant 
had made a contribution to the whole electricity system of ``Mid``.

Because of the adequate power supply in ``Mid`` the parameters ``delay``, ``cap-max-do``
and ``cap-max-up`` were set to 0. It means that there was no more DSM in the electricity
system of ``Mid`` to constraint the commodities.
